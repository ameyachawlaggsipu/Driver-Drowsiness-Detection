Opensource work done for my mentorship program Delta Winter of Code




## Problem Statement:
<p>Detect whether the driver is drowsy, sleepy or active.</p>

## Approach used
<p>The main goal of this project is to detect drowsiness to avoid accidents on road caused by it .</p>

->> Image Input          : Used cv2 to take image input . 

->> Preprocessing        : Converted the image to gray scale for better detection.

->> FaceDetection        : Used dblib library for face and landmarks detection.

->> Methodology          : Used ratio of opened eye height and width to find out about driver status .
